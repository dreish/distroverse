DVTP, the Distroverse Transfer Protocol, defines a standard interface
for transmitting sensory information from a server to a client (through
a "proxy" Java application), and for transmitting control information
from a client to a program (also through the "proxy").

The classes in org.distroverse.dvtp, together with their inline
documentation, constitute the authoritative definition of DVTP.
