DVTP, the Distroverse Transfer Protocol, defines a standard interface
for transmitting sensory information from a server to a client (through
a "proxy" Java application), and for transmitting control information
from a client to a program (also through the "proxy").

The classes in org.distroverse.dvtp, together with their inline
documentation, constitute the authoritative definition of DVTP.

Unlike all the other Distroverse code, which is licensed under the GPL
v3.0, everything in org.distroverse.dvop and org.distroverse.dvtp is
licensed under the LGPL v3.0.
