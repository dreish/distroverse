(Warning: I haven't thought about this in several months.)

DVOP, the Distroverse Object Protocol, defines a standard interface for
transmitting complete objects from one program to another.  A server
may implement DVOP without necessarily accepting every correctly-formed
object transmitted to it, but no program should claim to implement DVOP
if it generates incorrectly-formed objects, such as objects containing
program code other than Java.

The classes in org.distroverse.dvop, together with their inline
documentation, constitute the authoritative definition of DVOP.  DVOP
makes use of DVTP classes.
