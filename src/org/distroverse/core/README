org.distroverse.core includes utility classes that may be used in both
the Distroverse Viewer client and the Distroplane reference server,
but that are not part of either the DVTP or DVOP protocols.  (Util is
used in the implementation of some of the protocol classes, and is
therefore licensed under the LGPL.)
